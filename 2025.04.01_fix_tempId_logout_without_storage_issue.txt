2025.04.01_fix_tempId_logout_without_storage_issue.txt

Issue Analysis
Inconsistent tempId Handling:
- In GuestLogin.jsx, we correctly check if a tempId exists in localStorage. However, the tempId was not properly passed in API service calls.
- In the logout logic inside Home.jsx, comments suggest that we should retain the tempId, but the actual implementation is unclear.

Backend Handling:
- The logic in tempUserController.js seems correct—it checks the provided tempId from the client. We added more logging to assist with diagnostics.

Logout Handling:
- The logoutUser controller clears the JWT cookie but does not affect the tempId stored in localStorage. However, there might be parts of the frontend code that accidentally clear localStorage.tempId.

Solution
Frontend API Call:
- Modified the apiService.auth.createTempUser method to accept and pass tempId to the backend.

GuestLogin Logic:
- Added log statements to help trace the tempId transmission process.

Logout Logic:
- Updated the handleLogout function in Home.jsx to explicitly retain the tempId in localStorage. Log statements were added for clarity.

Backend (tempUserController):
- Additional logs were added to help diagnose tempId-related issues.

These changes should fix the issue of the temporary user ID being lost after logout. Now, when users:
- Visit the app for the first time and log in as a guest, a new tempId is created and stored in localStorage.
- Log out, the tempId remains in localStorage.
- Log in again as a guest, the stored tempId is sent to the backend, which verifies and returns the same temporary user.

This ensures that the user continues using the same temporary account across sessions without creating a new one each time—matching the behavior described in the README.
