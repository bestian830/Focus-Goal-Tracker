Key Changes:

a) Frontend – GuestLogin.jsx:
Modified the handleGuestLogin function to always send a request to the backend, regardless of whether a tempId already exists.
The key update is passing the locally stored tempId as the existingTempId parameter to the backend, allowing the server to verify its validity and return the corresponding user info.

b) Backend – tempUserRoutes.js:
Added logic to handle the existingTempId sent from the client.
First, it checks if the provided tempId exists; if it does, it returns the existing user.
Also added detailed logging for easier debugging and tracking.

c) Frontend – Home.jsx:
Updated the guest logout logic to no longer delete the temp user data.
Key change: Keep the tempId in localStorage while only clearing the cookie.
This allows the user to log in again using the same temp account, maintaining data continuity.
