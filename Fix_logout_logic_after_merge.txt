Fix logout logic after merge: handle 401 error when session is already cleared

- Pair-programming with https://github.com/bestian830
- Resolved an issue where calling the logout API would result in a 401 error if the session had already expired or the cookie was cleared.
- Updated logout logic to:
  - For guest users:  
    - Attempt to call logout API but catch and ignore errors if session no longer exists.  
    - Preserve `tempId` in localStorage for potential reuse.  
  - For registered users:  
    - Call logout API and remove `userId` from localStorage upon success.
- Ensured `withCredentials` is used in all logout API calls to properly include cookies.
- Added error handling to allow local cleanup to proceed even if API call fails.
