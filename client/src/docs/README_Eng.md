# Focus Goal Tracker - Frontend Merge Plan

## Merge Overview

This document outlines the frontend code merging strategy to integrate different code structures and implementations from two developers.

## Completed Work

### 1. File Structure Integration ‚úÖ

Successfully retained the advantages of both structures:
- `pages/` directory: Maintained complete pages with full interaction logic, including user authentication
- `components/` directory: Preserved modular UI components

### 2. Home.jsx Merge ‚úÖ

- **Preserve Original Authentication Logic**:
  - Maintained user state management (`user`, `loading`, `showProfileModal`, etc.)
  - Kept logout and modal toggle functionality
  - Fixed 401 error issue in logout functionality

- **Header Component Extraction**:
  - Extracted the original header section into a standalone `Header.jsx` component
  - Ensured correct props passing (user, loading, handleLogout, toggleProfileModal)

- **Integrated Partner's Components** ‚úÖ:
  - Used `<Sidebar />`, `<GoalDetails />`, `<ProgressReport />` components in the `main-content` section
  - Preserved conditional rendering, only showing components after user login
  - Maintained welcome message for non-logged-in users

- **Kept ProfileModal** ‚úÖ:
  - Preserved the original profile modal functionality

### 3. Style Management ‚úÖ

- **CSS File Optimization**:
  - Created `ComponentStyles.css` to integrate partner's component styles
  - Removed redundant `style.css` and `index.css` files
  - Retained `Home.css` and `App.css` as primary layout and global styles
  - Optimized UI design, enhancing visual effects and user experience

### 4. Functionality Testing üîÑ

- **Logout Function Fix** ‚úÖ:
  - Resolved 401 Unauthorized error issues
  - Ensured local cleanup completion even when API calls fail
  - Enhanced error handling capabilities

- **Other Functionality Tests** üîÑ:
  - Ongoing testing of functionality after component integration
  - Verification of user authentication flows (login/logout)
  - Validation of Profile functionality

## Next Steps

### 1. Feature Expansion
- Implement goal creation and editing functionality
- Add progress tracking and task management features
- Develop data visualization and reporting capabilities

### 2. User Experience Enhancement
- Further optimize responsive design for mobile devices
- Add animations and transition effects
- Implement dark mode and theme customization

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image and resource optimization
- Caching strategy implementation

## Project Milestones

- ‚úÖ **Iteration 1**: Establish basic architecture, implement frontend-backend connection, complete user authentication
- üîÑ **Iteration 2**: Expand core functionality, enhance user experience, add goal management
- üìù **Iteration 3**: Refine the application, add advanced features, ensure responsive design

## Notes

- The merged code preserves the original user authentication logic with enhanced error handling
- Component-based structure makes the code more maintainable and extensible
- Style optimization improves the application's professionalism and visual consistency
- Compatibility with the existing authentication system must be ensured when adding new features
