Fix: Implement Reward Synchronization between GoalDeclaration and DailyCard

This commit implements a robust reward synchronization system to ensure
that when rewards are updated in the GoalDeclaration component, they are
immediately reflected when opening a DailyCard.

Key changes:

1. Create a new Zustand store (rewardsStore.js) to:
   - Store and manage reward data centrally
   - Handle both daily rewards and declaration rewards
   - Maintain proper priority with declaration rewards taking precedence

2. Update GoalDeclaration.jsx to:
   - Store rewards in Zustand when declarations are saved
   - Ensure data is propagated to other components

3. Update DailyCard.jsx to:
   - Detect reward changes from the Zustand store
   - Correctly pass current reward data to DailyCardRecord

4. Update DailyCardRecord.jsx to:
   - Prioritize rewards from Zustand store
   - Stay in sync with goal declaration changes
   - Update UI display when rewards change

This implementation addresses the issue where updating a reward in the
declaration (e.g., changing "testrewards" to "testrewards2") wasn't 
immediately reflected when opening a daily card.
